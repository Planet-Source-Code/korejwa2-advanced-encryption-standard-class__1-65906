## Advanced Encryption Standard Class


</div>

### Description

Fast and efficient military grade encryption in a single class that can be added to any project. AES (128 bit blocksize Rijndael with 128, 192, or 256 bit keysize) is used by the US government to protect SECRET and (with 192 or 256 bit keys) TOP SECRET classified data.

Unlike other block ciphers, AES is efficient in VB because encrypting a block can be done using only CopyMemory, Xor, and a few bit masks in the final round.

This class can be set to support all Rijndael key and block sizes. (128, 160, 192, 224, 256)
